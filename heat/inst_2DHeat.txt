*  First of, I apologize its wonky. 
 *
 *  Email me ktibbett@uncc.edu with any issues/concerns with this. Dr. Saule or the other
 *    TA's are not familiar with how it works. 
 *
 * Params:
 *  n - is the same N from the command line, NOT the process's part of N
 *  P - the total amount of processes ie what MPI_Comm_size gives you.
 *  k - assumes n/2 > k-1 , otherwise may return false negatives.
 *
 *   
 * Disclaimer:
 ***
 *** Broken for P is 9. Gives false negatives, for me it was always
 ***  ranks 0, 3, 6. I have not found issues with 1, 4, or 16, and these
 ***  are what `make test` will use.
 ***
 *
 * Usage:
 *  When code is WRONG returns TRUE. Short example below
 *  if (check2DHeat(...)) {
 *    // oh no it is (maybe) wrong  
 *    std::cout<<"rank: "<<rank<<" is incorrect"<<std::endl;
 *  }
 *
 *
 *
 *  I suggest commenting this out when running the bench
